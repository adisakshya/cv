\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm a third year computer science major at Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology, affiliated to Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha Univeristy. I have been looking for an opportunity to work with MIDAS for some time now. I'm writing to you to inquire about the possibility of a summer internship in your group of researchers. ---------- WHY RESEARCH ----------. I'm extremely interested in pursuing independent research and a good internship would consolidate my future career choice.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have also worked on xyz and mno in the past and have done some relevant course work during in my college too.The need to connect basic research and applications of these research activities are well-recognized. As an intern at Intellify, an initiative led by Solve - India’s largest youth-led
foundation, I gained valuable experience working with people from diverse
domains. I also learned to think on my feet and have given me a solid foundation
in the tools, processes and methodologies involved in creating a solid design and
development of solutions for a problem. In addition, from being involved with
many extracurricular groups during both high school and college, and
maintaining solid grades at the same time, I know I can handle multiple
responsibilities and successfully meet deadlines. I have a proven ability to learn
challenging concepts quickly

\lettersection{Conclusion}
Please let me know if the possibility of a summer internship exists in your group. I would be glad to discuss more about my credentials and what role I can play in your group over the summer.
